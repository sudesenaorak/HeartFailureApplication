# Heart Failure Detection Application

## Overview

This repository contains a desktop application for heart failure detection. The application leverages machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB),  Gradient Boosting Machines (GBC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN).

## Machine Learning Models

The heart failure detection process involves training multiple machine learning models on relevant datasets. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and true positive level, and the best-performing model is selected for the application.

- SVM
- KNN
- LR
- RFC
- GNB
- GBC
- ANN
- DNN

The accuracy of each model is thoroughly analyzed, and the model with the highest accuracy is chosen to power the heart failure detection feature in the desktop application.

## Desktop Application

The desktop application is designed to be user-friendly and caters to the needs of doctors and laborants. It provides an interface for entering patient data and obtaining predictions on the likelihood of heart failure. The selected machine learning model is integrated into the application to ensure accurate predictions.

## File Structure

- `/Models`: This directory contains the trained machine learning models.
- `app.py`: Source code for the desktop application.
- `heart.csv`: Datasets used for training and evaluation.
